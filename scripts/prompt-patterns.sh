# - what i need to put in my methodology to improve claude ai on every task 

# Task Execution Methodology Workflow
# **Think carefully Step-by-Step**
#    - Analyze the current task requirements
#    - Minimize the scope to essential features
#    - Identify key patterns to apply
#    - Identify patterns that can be reused
#    - Identify dependencies and potential risks
#    - Document assumptions and constraints
#    - Document before claude auto-compact
# 0. **Initialize Environment**
#    - Ensure all dependencies are installed
#    - Validate environment setup
#    - Check existing code coverage
#    - Verify dependencies installed
#    - Review existing patterns in ./patterns
#    - Ensure all patterns are version controlled
# 1. **Review Historical Context**
#    - Examine previous session logs.
#    - Review git history for related changes
#    - Identify patterns from past issues
#    - Analyze previous patterns applied
# 2. **Run Tests**
#    - Execute tests in ./tests
#    - Validate test coverage
#    - Ensure all tests pass
#    - Document test results
#    - If tests fail:
#      ```
#      WHILE tests_fail():
#          - Analyze test failures
#          - Identify root cause
#          - Implement fix
#          - Re-run tests
#          - Verify fix effectiveness
#      ```  
#    - Identify failing tests
# 3. **Continuous Validation**
#    - Run tests after each change

      - Check git status for conflicts
      - Validate tool availability
      - Set up rollback point
      - Define test validation command
  **Phase 2: Run Tests**
      - Store baseline metrics
      - Identify critical vs nice-to-have tests
      - Run quick smoke test first
      - Document which tests matter most
      - Skip lengthy tests during development
  **Phase 3: Continuous Validation** 
      - Incremental test runs (not full suite)
      - Performance regression checks
      - User experience validation
      - Accessibility spot checks
      - Mobile responsiveness verification
  **Phase 4: Run Quality Checks**
   WHILE issues_detected():
       - Identify root cause
       - Analyze impact
       - Implement fix
       - Re-run validation
       - Verify fix effectiveness
  **Phase 5: Pattern Optimization**
      - Review patterns in ./patterns
      - Identify patterns for optimization
      - Apply optimization techniques
      - Ensure patterns are reusable and maintainable
      - Document optimized patterns
  **Phase 6: Post-Cleanup Validation**
      IF cleanup_introduced_issues():
         GOTO Phase 3: Quality Assurance
  **Phase 7: Documentation**
    - Update CLAUDE.md with learned patterns
    - Document ROI calculations
    - Record command sequences
    - Note time savings
    - Create reusable snippets



  **Phase 9: Task Principles**
  
  This meta-learning loop ensures Claude gets better with every single task, creating a
  compound improvement effect that multiplies value over time.
